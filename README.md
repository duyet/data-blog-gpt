# Data Engineering Blog by GPT-3

Welcome to Data Engineering Blog by GPT-3, where all the content is generated by OpenAI GPT-3.5 model through [Github Actions](https://github.com/duyet/data-blog-gpt/actions/workflows/generator.yml).

## How It Works

The Data Engineering Blog by GPT-3 utilizes Github Actions and Deno script to generate content using the OpenAI GPT-3.5 model. Here's a step-by-step overview of the process:

1. **Github Actions Workflow**: The Github Actions workflow is configured to trigger the Deno script (`./gen.ts`) when changes are pushed to the `master` branch or on a scheduled `@hourly`.

2. **Content Generation**: The Deno script sends prompts to the GPT-3.5 model via the API, requesting it to generate content in Markdown format. The prompts may include instructions for the model to act like a technical content writer and generate a data engineering blog post. Topics for the blog post may be randomly picked if not explicitly mentioned in the prompts.

3. **Markdown Content**: The generated content is received from the GPT-3 API and formatted as Markdown. The content may include headings, paragraphs, bullet points, and other Markdown syntax elements, making it suitable for rendering as a blog post.

4. **Auto Commit and Push**: The Deno script automatically creates a new .mdx file with the generated content, commits it to the master branch, and pushes the changes back to the repository. This triggers to deploy to Vercel.
