# Understanding Airflow for Data Engineering

![Airflow Logo](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/_images/pin_large.png)

Apache Airflow is an open-source platform used for workflow management and scheduling. It is written in Python and is highly customizable, making it a popular choice among data engineers. Airflow allows users to define their workflows as code, making it easier to understand, test, and maintain. In this article, we will go through the fundamental knowledge of Airflow, its features, and how to use it.

## Airflow Features

Airflow provides several features that make it an excellent choice for data engineers. Here are some of its features:

### Easy to Use

Airflow has a simple and intuitive user interface. It allows users to easily create and manage workflows, schedule tasks, and monitor their progress.

### Scalable

Airflow can handle tens of thousands of tasks per day, and its architecture is designed to scale horizontally.

### Extensible

Airflow is highly extensible, allowing users to create their own operators, sensors, and hooks to integrate with virtually any API or process.

### Reusable

Airflow workflows are reusable, meaning they can be created once and used multiple times.

### Dynamic

Airflow workflows can be easily changed or updated as requirements change. This makes it easier to adapt to changing business needs.

### Modular

Airflow workflows are made up of individual tasks, which can be combined to create complex workflows. This allows users to build workflows that are exactly tailored to their needs.

## Airflow Concepts

### DAGs

In Airflow, workflows are defined as Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs). A DAG is a collection of tasks that need to be executed in a specific order. A DAG consists of nodes and edges. Nodes represent tasks, and edges represent dependencies between tasks.

### Operators

Operators are Airflow's building blocks. They represent an individual task that needs to be executed. Airflow comes with several built-in operators that can be used to perform common tasks such as transferring data between databases, running a SQL query, or executing a Python function. Users can also create their own custom operators.

### Sensors

Sensors are used to wait for a specific event to occur before proceeding to the next task. For example, a sensor could wait for a file to arrive in a specified directory before starting the next task in the workflow.

### Hooks

Hooks are used to integrate with external systems such as databases or APIs. Airflow comes with several built-in hooks that can be used to integrate with commonly used systems such as MySQL, AWS S3, or Google Cloud Storage. Users can also create their own custom hooks.

### Variables

In Airflow, variables are used to store key-value pairs. They can be used to store configuration settings or other data that needs to be shared between tasks in a DAG.

### Connections

Connections are used to store connection information to external systems such as databases or APIs. Airflow comes with several built-in connections that can be used to connect to commonly used systems such as MySQL, AWS S3, or Google Cloud Storage. Users can also create their own custom connections.

## Using Airflow

### Installation

To install Airflow, it is recommended to use pip. You can install Airflow using the following code snippet: 

```
pip install apache-airflow
```

### Configuration

The main configuration file for Airflow is located at `~/airflow/airflow.cfg`. This file contains several configuration settings, including the location of the Airflow database, the location of the DAGs folder, and the default executor.

### Running Airflow

To start Airflow, you can use the following command:

```
airflow webserver -p 8080
```

This will start the Airflow web server on port 8080. To start the scheduler, you can use the following command:

```
airflow scheduler
```

This will start the Airflow scheduler, which is responsible for executing DAGs at their scheduled times.

### Creating a DAG

To create a DAG in Airflow, you first need to create a Python script that defines your workflow. This script should import the necessary modules and define the DAG.

```python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
from airflow import DAG
from airflow.operators.bash_operator import BashOperator
from airflow.operators.dummy_operator import DummyOperator

default_args = {
    'owner': 'airflow',
    'depends_on_past': False,
    'start_date': datetime(2022, 1, 1),
    'email': ['airflow@example.com'],
    'email_on_failure': False,
    'email_on_retry': False,
    'retries': 1,
    'retry_delay': timedelta(minutes=1),
}

dag = DAG(
    'example_dag',
    default_args=default_args,
    description='An example DAG',
    schedule_interval=timedelta(days=1),
)

t1 = BashOperator(
    task_id='task_1',
    bash_command='echo "Hello World from Task 1"',
    dag=dag,
)

t2 = DummyOperator(
    task_id='task_2',
    dag=dag,
)

t3 = BashOperator(
    task_id='task_3',
    bash_command='echo "Hello World from Task 3"',
    dag=dag,
)

t1 >> t2 >> t3
```

Once you have created your DAG script, save it to the DAGs folder specified in the `airflow.cfg` configuration file.

### Running a DAG

To run a DAG, you can use the following command:

```
airflow trigger_dag example_dag
```

This command will start your DAG and the tasks defined in your DAG will be executed in the specified order.

### Monitoring a DAG

Airflow provides a web UI that can be used to monitor DAGs and their tasks. The web UI can be accessed by navigating to `http://localhost:8080` (assuming you started the web server on port 8080).

## Conclusion

Airflow is a powerful tool for managing workflows and scheduling tasks. It provides several features that make it an excellent choice for data engineers. Airflow's simple and intuitive user interface, scalability, extensibility, reusability, and dynamic nature makes it an attractive tool for managing complex workflows. This article has covered fundamental knowledge of Airflow, its features, and how to use it. With this knowledge, data engineers can start building their own workflows using Airflow.
