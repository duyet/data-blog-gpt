# Understanding Airflow for Data Engineering

Airflow is an open source platform that was designed to programmatically orchestrate workflows. It allows you to schedule the execution of different tasks that make up a data pipeline and monitor their progress. Airflow provides a way to build, schedule, and monitor data pipelines that move and transform data across systems and applications. In this blog post, we will explore the fundamental concepts of Airflow for data engineering.

## Architecture

The core of Airflow is its powerful distributed execution architecture. The Airflow architecture is built on three key components: the web server, the scheduler, and the worker.

- **Web server**: It provides the user interface for users to interact with the Airflow system where users can define and trigger workflows, track their progress, and view their results.
- **Scheduler**: The scheduler automates the execution of workflows. It reads the workflow definitions from the database and schedules tasks as per the defined dependencies.
- **Worker**: Workers, also called executors, are the processes that execute tasks. 

The architecture is scalable as more workers can be added to support an increasing number of tasks and workflows. 

## Concepts

Following are the key concepts in Airflow:

### 1. DAGs and tasks

Airflow uses Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) to represent workflows. A DAG is composed of tasks that represent individual units of work. Each task can be considered as a node in the DAG. Tasks are Python functions or external scripts that are executed in response to certain events. Dependencies between tasks are defined when a DAG is created. 

### 2. Operators

Operators are what actually execute tasks. They represent a single action in a workflow, such as running a SQL query or transferring data to a remote system. Airflow has a lot of built-in operators, such as Bash operator, Python operator, Kubernetes operator, and more. Furthermore, Airflow allows you to create your own operators.

### 3. Sensors

Sensors are another type of operator that waits for a certain condition to be met before moving onto the next task in the workflow. These conditions can include file availability, database table updates, message queue contents, or any other data source that can be monitored. 

### 4. Hooks

Hooks provide a simple way for tasks to interact with external systems. They are used to connect to databases, message queues, and other data sources. Airflow provides hooks for most of the common data sources, and you can easily create your own if needed. 

### 5. Executors

Executors are responsible for executing tasks. Airflow comes with several executors, including LocalExecutor, SequentialExecutor, CeleryExecutor, and more. Each executor has its own unique way of performing tasks, and you can choose the executor that best suits your use case.

## Usage

Let's take a look at how to use Airflow to create a simple DAG:

```python
from airflow import DAG
from airflow.operators.dummy_operator import DummyOperator
from datetime import datetime

dag = DAG(dag_id='my_dag', start_date=datetime.now())

task_1 = DummyOperator(task_id='task_1', dag=dag)
task_2 = DummyOperator(task_id='task_2', dag=dag)

task_1 >> task_2
```

This code defines a simple DAG which has two dummy operators as tasks which do nothing. The `>>` operator defines a dependency between the two tasks, making `task_1` a prerequisite for `task_2`.

This is just the tip of the iceberg. Airflow provides a vast number of features to support complex data workflows, such as dynamic DAG generation, conditional logic, external triggers, and more.

## Conclusion

Airflow is a powerful tool for data engineering that helps you to create, schedule, and monitor workflows. In this blog post, we learned about the architecture and key concepts of Airflow. While this was just an introduction, there is a lot more to Airflow than covered in this post.
