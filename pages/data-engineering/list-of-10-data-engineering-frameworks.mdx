# List of 10 Data Engineering Frameworks

Data Engineering is a complex field that involves a lot of data processing, storage, and analysis. There are various tools and frameworks that data engineers can use to make their job more efficient and effective. In this post, we will list 10 data engineering frameworks you should consider adding to your toolkit, and then dive deeper into the details of one of them.

## 1. Apache Spark
Apache Spark is a distributed computing framework that enables parallel processing of large data sets. It is an open-source framework written in Scala and supports multiple programming languages such as Python, Java, and R. It is widely used for data processing, machine learning, graph processing and more.

## 2. Apache Hadoop
Apache Hadoop is an open-source framework that is used for distributed storage and processing of large data sets. It is based on the MapReduce programming model and supports data handling for structured, unstructured data and data processing in batch, real-time, interactive and graph processing modes.

## 3. Apache Kafka
Apache Kafka is a high-throughput messaging system that is used for real-time data streaming and processing. It is widely used for building large scale real-time data pipelines and for event-driven architectures.

## 4. Apache Flink
Apache Flink is an open-source stream processing framework that enables high-performance, data-intensive, real-time data processing. It is used for batch processing, stream processing, and graph processing.

## 5. Apache Beam
Apache Beam is an open-source framework that provides a programming model that is used for parallel data processing. The model enables the same code to be executed on different processing systems such as Apache Flink, Apache Spark, and Google Cloud Dataflow.

## 6. Luigi
Luigi is an open-source Python framework that is used for building data pipelines. It provides an abstraction layer over complex workflows, task scheduling, dependency management, and monitoring.

## 7. Airflow
Airflow is an open-source platform that is used for workflow automation, scheduling, data profiling, and management. It is written in Python and provides a simple and scalable way to manage data pipelines.

## 8. Apache Nifi
Apache Nifi is an open-source data integration platform that is used for building and managing data pipelines. It is a web-based platform that enables visual programming, drag and drop, and allows you to build reusable templates.

## 9. Apache Beam
Apache Beam is an open-source framework for building batch and streaming data processing pipelines. Its programming model is designed to be portable and can be used to run pipelines on different processing engines such as Apache Flink, Apache Spark, and Google Cloud Dataflow.

## 10. Databricks
Databricks is a cloud-based platform that is used for building and managing data pipelines, providing end-to-end machine learning pipelines, data lakehouse architecture, and business intelligence capabilities.

## Detail about Apache Flink

Now that we have listed ten data engineering frameworks, let's take a closer look at one of them â€“ Apache Flink.

Apache Flink is an open-source, distributed processing system that is used for batch, stream, and graph processing. It provides a fault-tolerant runtime, data streaming processing, and supports iterations, machine learning, and graph processing.

One of the most significant features of Apache Flink is its support for stateful computation. This means that Apache Flink can handle operations over an infinite data stream while keeping track of all the previous states. This capability makes it possible to use a more robust and complex processing system while still achieving low latency compared to traditional batch processing frameworks.

Apache Flink was designed to support stream processing with the concept of windows. Windows are used to segment data in streams, and operations can be performed on the data within the window. For example, operations like filtering, aggregation, and joining can be performed on the data within a specific window.

Apache Flink's ability to process streaming data with low latency makes it an excellent choice for real-time event processing, internet of things (IoT), and fraud detection. Additionally, its fault-tolerant processing system makes it possible to achieve zero data loss, making it a reliable choice for critical data processing.
