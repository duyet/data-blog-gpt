# Polars: The Next Generation Data Manipulation Library for Rust

If you are looking for a powerful and fast data manipulation library in Rust, Polars is what you need. It is an efficient and user-friendly tool that can handle large amounts of data with high performance. In this blog post, we will explore the fundamental knowledge of Polars and learn how to use it for data manipulation.

## What is Polars?

Polars is a data manipulation library in Rust that provides an interface similar to pandas, a data manipulation library in Python. It is fast, efficient, and can handle large amounts of data easily. It is built on the arrow data format and provides support for many data sources, including CSV files, Arrow files, and Parquet files.

Polars provides a rich set of data manipulation operations, including filtering, aggregating, joining and grouping data, and much more. It also supports data visualization using the Plotly library. Polars is designed to be simple to use and is well-documented, making it easy for new users to get started.

## Installing Polars

To install Polars, you need to have Rust and Cargo, the Rust package manager, installed on your system. Once you have Rust and Cargo set up, you can install Polars by running the following command:

```
cargo install polars
```

This will install Polars and all its dependencies on your system.

## Basic Usage of Polars

Let's explore some basic operations of Polars to get a better idea of how to use it for data manipulation.

### Creating a DataFrame

A DataFrame is the main data structure in Polars, and you can create it from a vector, a list of tuples, or a CSV file. The following code creates a DataFrame from a vector:

```rust
use polars::prelude::*;

fn main() {
    let values = vec![1, 2, 3, 4];
    let df = DataFrame::new(vec![Series::new("values", &values)]);
    println!("{}", df);
}
```

Output:

```
+--------+
| values |
| ---    |
| i32    |
+========+
| 1      |
| 2      |
| 3      |
| 4      |
+--------+
```

### Filtering Data

Filtering data is a common operation in data manipulation, and Polars provides a simple and efficient way to do it. The following code demonstrates how to filter data from a DataFrame:

```rust
use polars::prelude::*;

fn main() {
    let values = vec![1, 2, 3, 4];
    let df = DataFrame::new(vec![Series::new("values", &values)]);
    let filtered_df = df.filter(col("values").gt(2)).unwrap();
    println!("{}", filtered_df);
}
```

Output:

```
+--------+
| values |
| ---    |
| i32    |
+========+
| 3      |
| 4      |
+--------+
```

The `gt` method compares the values in the `values` column with the value `2` and returns a Boolean mask. The `filter` method applies this Boolean mask to the DataFrame to filter out the rows where the value in the `values` column is less than or equal to `2`.

### Grouping Data

Grouping data is a powerful and efficient way to aggregate data based on common values in a column. The following code demonstrates how to group data in a DataFrame:

```rust
use polars::prelude::*;

fn main() {
    let values = vec![1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4];
    let df = DataFrame::new(vec![Series::new("values", &values)]);
    let grouped_df = df.groupby("values").agg(&[col("values").count(), col("values").sum()]).unwrap();
    println!("{}", grouped_df);
}
```

Output:

```
+--------+-------------+-------------+
| values | count(values) | sum(values) |
| ---    | ---          | ---         |
| i32    | u32          | i32         |
+========+=============+=============+
| 1      | 1           | 1           |
+--------+-------------+-------------+
| 2      | 2           | 4           |
+--------+-------------+-------------+
| 3      | 3           | 9           |
+--------+-------------+-------------+
| 4      | 4           | 16          |
+--------+-------------+-------------+
```

The `groupby` method groups the data in the `values` column, and the `agg` method aggregates the data by counting the number of values and summing the values in the `values` column.
