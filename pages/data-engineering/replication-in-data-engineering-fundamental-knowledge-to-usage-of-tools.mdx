# Replication in Data Engineering: Fundamental Knowledge to Usage of Tools

Data replication is a process of duplicating data from one database or data store to another. It is an essential aspect of data engineering as it helps organizations to improve business continuity, enhance disaster recovery, and achieve high availability of applications. These are some of the reasons why data replication is essential in data engineering.

In this post, we will discuss the fundamentals of data replication, how it works and the various tools and techniques used in data engineering. We will also provide examples of how to replicate data using various technologies.

## Fundamentals of Data Replication

Data replication involves copying data from one location to another. This process can happen between databases, data centers, or within a data store. The data can be replicated in near real-time or at regular intervals.

### How Data Replication Works

The process of data replication typically involves the following steps:

1. Data capture: The replication software captures data from the source database or data store. This is usually done using log-based or trigger-based mechanisms.

2. Data transformation: The captured data is transformed into a format that can be easily replicated to the destination database or data store. This could involve converting data types, applying filters or aggregating data.

3. Data transfer: The transformed data is transported to the destination database or data store. The method of transfer can vary depending on the replication technology being used.

4. Data apply: The data is applied to the destination database or data store.

### Types of Data Replication

There are several types of data replication techniques used in data engineering. These include:

#### 1. Snapshot Replication

Snapshot replication involves taking a copy of the entire database and transferring it to the destination database. This process can be time-consuming and can put a strain on the source database during the replication process.

#### 2. Transactional Replication

Transactional replication is a near real-time replication technique that involves capturing and transferring individual transactions from the source database to the destination database. This technique is commonly used in high availability and disaster recovery scenarios.

#### 3. Merge Replication

Merge replication is a technique that involves replicating changes made to the source database to the destination database. This process involves comparing changes made to the database and reconciling them to ensure data consistency.

## Tools and Techniques Used in Data Replication

There are several tools and techniques used in data replication. Here are some of the common ones:

### 1. Oracle GoldenGate

Oracle GoldenGate is a popular tool used for data replication. It supports various databases, data types and can be applied to both on-premise and cloud-based environments. GoldenGate can replicate data in real-time and can be configured to support high availability and disaster recovery.

### 2. Amazon Web Services (AWS) Database Migration Services (DMS)

AWS DMS is a fully managed service that enables organizations to migrate databases to AWS. DMS supports various migration scenarios, including homogeneous migrations (such as Oracle to Oracle) and heterogeneous migrations (such as Oracle to Amazon Aurora). DMS also supports near real-time replication to enable high availability and disaster recovery scenarios.

### 3. Apache Kafka

Apache Kafka is an open-source distributed streaming platform used to build real-time data pipelines and streaming applications. Kafka supports data replication across clusters and data centers and provides fault-tolerance by replicating data across multiple nodes.

### 4. Microsoft SQL Server Replication

Microsoft SQL Server Replication is another tool used for data replication. It supports various replication scenarios, including snapshot and transactional replication. SQL Server Replication can be configured to support high availability and disaster recovery scenarios.

## Example: Replicating Data Using Oracle GoldenGate

Here's an example of how to replicate data using Oracle GoldenGate:

1. Install Oracle GoldenGate on the source and target systems.

2. Create a GoldenGate extract process to capture changes from the source database.

3. Create a GoldenGate replicat process to apply the captured changes to the destination database.

4. Configure GoldenGate to replicate data in real-time by setting parameters such as the heartbeat interval and the buffer size.

5. Initiate the replication process to start replicating data from the source database to the destination database.

## Conclusion

Data replication is a crucial aspect of data engineering that enables organizations to improve business continuity, enhance disaster recovery, and achieve high application availability. In this post, we have discussed the fundamentals of data replication, the various types of data replication, and the tools and techniques used in data replication. We have also provided an example of how to replicate data using Oracle GoldenGate.
