# Replication in Data Engineering: Fundamental Knowledge to Usage of Tools

Data replication is a process in which data is copied from one database to another or from one node to another. Replication enables data redundancy which ensures high availability and reliability of the data. In this blog post, we will delve into the concepts of replication, its types, and the tools used for replication.

## Understanding Replication

Replication is a process of copying data from one source to one or more destinations. The data is usually copied in real-time or near real-time, meaning the copies are almost identical to the original data. It is important to ensure that the copies (also called replicas) are synchronous, meaning they have the same data, at the same time. Otherwise, this may result in inconsistencies causing severe data issues.

Replication has become a crucial aspect of data engineering since it enables data redundancy, which ensures high availability of data. Replication can be applied to all types of data sources, including databases, file systems, network file systems, and cloud storage.

## Types of Replication

There are three main types of replication: Master-Slave Replication, Master-Master Replication, and Multi-Master Replication.

### Master-Slave Replication

Master-Slave Replication is a replication type in which a single master node writes data on the slave nodes. The master node serves as the primary replica, while the slave nodes serve as secondary replicas that store a copy of the data from the master node. Slave nodes are read-only nodes that cannot modify data and can be used for backup and disaster recovery.

Master-Slave Replication is a great solution when you need to distribute reads across multiple nodes, thereby reducing the load on the master node. For example, a high-volume MySQL application can use Master-Slave replication to replicate all writes from the master node to the secondary nodes. The secondary nodes can then serve read traffic to offload the reads from the primary node.

### Master-Master Replication

Master-Master Replication is a form of replication that allows multiple master nodes to write data on each other. The data is updated on all the nodes and is usually stored locally. In this way, all nodes contain the same data.

Master-Master Replication is commonly used in high-availability environments where data is heavily updated, and a single master node cannot handle the load. It's also used in disaster recovery scenarios where data is replicated from a primary data center to a secondary data center.

### Multi-Master Replication

Multi-Master Replication is a replication type similar to Master-Master Replication, but it allows multiple nodes to write data to each other, and the data is not necessarily the same across all nodes. In this fashion, not all updates are replicated across all nodes. This allows for better scalability, faster writes, and reduced network traffic.

Multi-Master Replication is used in large-scale distributed environments, such as multi-regional setups of Oracle databases.

## Tools for Replication

There are several tools for replication, including the following:

### Apache Kafka

Apache Kafka is an open-source streaming platform that is known for its ability to handle high-throughput data streams. It provides high scalability, fault-tolerance, and reliable processing of streaming data. Kafka supports Master-Master Replication and Multi-Master Replication.

### Apache Storm

Apache Storm is an open-source real-time data processing system. It is used for stream processing, processing events, and creating a real-time view of the incoming data streams. Apache Storm supports multi-master replication.

### MySQL Replication

MySQL Replication is a native replication feature of MySQL Server. It supports Master-Slave Replication and Master-Master Replication. It's widely used for creating a high-availability environment, for disaster recovery, and for scaling out reads.

### PostgreSQL Replication

PostgreSQL replication capabilities include streaming replication and logical replication. Streaming replication is a native replication feature of PostgreSQL that supports Master-Slave Replication. It's widely used for creating a high-availability environment, disaster recovery, and scaling out read traffic.

## Conclusion

Replication is an essential part of data engineering, and it's crucial to understand the types of replication and the different tools available for data replication. Master-Slave Replication, Master-Master Replication, and Multi-Master Replication are the three main types of replication. MySQL Replication, PostgreSQL Replication, Apache Storm, and Apache Kafka are some of the tools commonly used in data replication.
