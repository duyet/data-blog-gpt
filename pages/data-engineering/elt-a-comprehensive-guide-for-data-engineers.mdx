# ELT: A Comprehensive Guide for Data Engineers

As more companies are tapping into the benefits of big data, data engineers are becoming increasingly important. Data engineers need to be able to collect and process large amounts of data, so that business analysts and data scientists can access it in a meaningful way. ETL (extract, transform, load) has long been the standard method for data processing. However, the need for real-time data analytics and processing has led to the development of a new approach: ELT (extract, load, transform).

In this article, we will explore ELT, its benefits, and how it differs from ETL. We will also discuss tools used for ELT and how to choose the right ones for your organization.

## What is ELT?

ELT is a data processing method that involves extracting data from various sources, loading it into a data storage system, and then transforming it in-place. Unlike ETL, which involves transforming data before loading it into storage, ELT does the transformation after loading the data. This is made possible by the increased processing power and storage capacity of modern computer systems.

The ELT approach allows for faster and more efficient data processing because it leverages the capabilities of modern data storage systems. By allowing data to be loaded into storage first, data engineers can take advantage of the processing power of the storage system for efficient data transformations.

ELT provides significant benefits over ETL, especially when it comes to scalability and agility. For one, ELT is easily scalable, allowing data engineers to add new data sources and data processing tasks as needed. It also allows for the processing of real-time data, making it ideal for organizations that need to analyze data in near-real time.

## ELT vs ETL

As previously mentioned, the main difference between ELT and ETL is the order in which data is transformed. ETL involves transforming the data before loading it into storage, while ELT transforms the data after it has been loaded.

Another key difference is in the tools used. ETL typically employs specialized tools that are designed for data transformation, while ELT uses general-purpose tools that are designed for data storage and processing. This makes ELT more flexible than ETL, as it allows data engineers to use a wider range of tools and technologies.

## Benefits of ELT

There are a number of benefits that come with using ELT. One of the biggest benefits is scalability. ELT is designed to be easily scalable, allowing organizations to add new data sources and processing tasks as needed. This makes it an ideal method for organizations with large amounts of data that need to be processed quickly.

ELT also allows for real-time data processing, making it possible to perform near-real-time data analysis. This is particularly beneficial for organizations that need to make quick decisions based on data analysis.

Another benefit of ELT is its flexibility. Because ELT uses general-purpose tools, data engineers can use a wide range of technologies to perform data processing tasks. This makes it easier to work with newer technologies and tools, as they can be easily integrated into existing data processing workflows.

## ELT Tools

There are a number of tools that data engineers can use for ELT. Some of the most popular tools include Apache Spark, AWS Glue, Talend, and Matillion. These tools allow data engineers to perform data transformations in a distributed and parallelized manner, which can significantly speed up data processing tasks.

When choosing an ELT tool, it is important to consider factors such as ease of use, scalability, and cost. Some ELT tools can be expensive, particularly if they require a significant amount of processing power or storage. It is also important to consider the level of technical expertise required to use the tool effectively.

## Conclusion

ELT is a powerful method for data processing that allows organizations to quickly and efficiently process large quantities of data. By leveraging the capabilities of modern data storage systems, ELT makes it possible to perform real-time data analysis, and easily scale data processing tasks. When choosing an ELT tool, it is important to consider factors such as ease of use, scalability, and cost, to ensure that it meets the needs of your organization.
