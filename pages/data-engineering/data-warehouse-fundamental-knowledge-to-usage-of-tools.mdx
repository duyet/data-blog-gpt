# Data Warehouse: Fundamental Knowledge to Usage of Tools

Data is everywhere and it is growing at an exponential rate. The need for storing, processing, and analyzing data efficiently has become a crucial aspect of organizations. Data Warehouses have been designed to meet the needs of storing and analyzing large volumes of data in a structured way. In this blog post, we will dive into the fundamental knowledge of Data Warehousing, its architecture, and the tools used in Data Warehousing.

## What is Data Warehouse?

A Data Warehouse is a central repository that stores large volumes of data from various sources. The data stored in a Data Warehouse is structured and is used for analysis and reporting purposes. Data Warehouses have been designed to support business intelligence activities like data mining, analysis, and reporting.

## Why Data Warehouse?

The traditional way of storing data in databases is not feasible when dealing with large volumes of data. Data Warehouses have been designed to meet the following requirements:

- **Performance:** Data Warehouses have been optimized for querying and reporting, which is not possible with traditional databases.
- **Scalability:** Data Warehouses can handle large volumes of data by adding more hardware resources.
- **Integration:** Data Warehouses can integrate data from various sources like databases, flat files, and other data sources.
- **Modeling:** Data Warehouses support data modeling techniques like star and snowflake schema to provide better query performance.

## Data Warehouse Architecture

A Data Warehouse is divided into different layers based on the functions they perform. The following are the layers of a Data Warehouse architecture:

- **Source Layer:** This is the first layer of a Data Warehouse architecture where data is extracted from various sources like databases, flat files, and other data sources.
- **ETL Layer:** This layer consists of ETL (Extract, Transform, and Load) tools, which are used for cleaning, transforming, and loading data into the Data Warehouse. This layer also includes the data staging area, where the data is temporarily stored before loading it into the Data Warehouse.
- **Data Warehouse Layer:** This layer consists of the actual Data Warehouse, where the data is stored in a structured way. The data stored in a Data Warehouse is optimized for query and reporting purposes.
- **Business Intelligence Layer:** This layer consists of various tools used for analysis, reporting, and visualization of data. The tools in this layer provide users with an easy-to-use interface for data analysis and reporting.

## Tools Used in Data Warehousing

There are various tools used in Data Warehousing for different purposes. The following are some of the commonly used tools in Data Warehousing:

### ETL Tools

ETL stands for Extract, Transform, and Load. ETL tools are used for processing large volumes of data by extracting data from various sources, transforming the data to fit the Data Warehouse schema, and then loading the data into the Data Warehouse. Some of the commonly used ETL tools are:

- **Talend:** An open-source ETL tool that is easy to use and supports a wide range of data sources.
- **Informatica:** A powerful ETL tool that provides real-time data integration and supports data quality and data governance.
- **SSIS (SQL Server Integration Services):** A Microsoft ETL tool that is easy to use and provides a wide range of data sources and transformations.

### Data Modeling Tools

Data modeling tools are used for designing and implementing the Data Warehouse schema. These tools enable the developers to design and implement the schema using visual interfaces. Some of the commonly used data modeling tools are:

- **ER Studio:** A powerful data modeling tool that provides a visual interface for designing Data Warehouse schema.
- **ERWin:** A widely used data modeling tool that provides a comprehensive set of features for designing complex Data Warehouse schema.

### Business Intelligence Tools

Business Intelligence tools are used for analysis, reporting, and visualization of data stored in the Data Warehouse. These tools provide an easy-to-use interface for users to analyze and report data. Some of the commonly used Business Intelligence tools are:

- **Tableau:** A powerful Business Intelligence tool that provides an easy-to-use drag and drop interface for visualizing data.
- **Power BI:** A Microsoft Business Intelligence tool that provides a user-friendly interface for creating stunning reports and dashboards.
- **QlikView:** A Business Intelligence tool that provides an easy-to-use interface for data analysis and reporting.

## Conclusion

Data Warehousing is a crucial aspect of modern-day organizations. With the growth of data, it has become essential for organizations to store and analyze data efficiently. In this blog post, we have covered the fundamental knowledge of Data Warehouse, its architecture, and the tools used in Data Warehousing. Understanding the architecture and the tools used in Data Warehousing will help organizations to improve their data management and make better decisions.
