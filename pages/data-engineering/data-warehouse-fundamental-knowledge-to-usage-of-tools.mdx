# Data Warehouse: Fundamental Knowledge to Usage of Tools

A data warehouse is a large and centralized repository of data designed to support decision-making activities. It usually consists of multiple tables and can be used for business analysis, forecasting, and trend analysis. In this article, we will look at the fundamentals of data warehousing, its benefits, and the tools used for its implementation.

## What is Data Warehousing?

Data warehousing refers to the process of collecting, cleaning, consolidating, and storing data from various sources into a centralized repository. The data stored in a data warehouse is typically historical, non-volatile, and subject-oriented. This means it is designed to answer specific questions for decision-making purposes.

Data warehousing is different from transactional databases. A transactional database is designed to capture and store data from daily transactions, while a data warehouse is designed to store data for analytical purposes.

## Benefits of Data Warehousing

Data warehousing offers several benefits to organizations. Some of the benefits include:

### 1. Easy Access to Data

Data warehouses consolidate data from various sources, making it easier to access for analysis. The centralized nature of data warehousing ensures that users can access the data they need without having to request it from various departments.

### 2. Better Decision-Making

Data warehousing provides decision-makers with a single, reliable source of data for decision-making. This ensures that decisions are based on accurate and consistent data, improving the quality of decision-making.

### 3. Improved Data Quality

Data warehousing involves a process of data cleansing and consolidation that ensures data quality is improved. This means that data stored in a data warehouse is more accurate, complete, and consistent.

### 4. Scalability

Data warehouses are designed to scale easily, making it possible to store and analyze large amounts of data as an organization grows.

## Tools for Data Warehousing

Several tools can be used for implementing a data warehouse. These tools fall into two categories: Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) tools and Business Intelligence tools.

### 1. Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) Tools

ETL tools are used for extracting data from various sources, transforming it to fit the data warehouse schema, and loading it into the warehouse. Some popular ETL tools include:

#### a. Talend

Talend is an open-source ETL tool used for data integration, data profiling, and data quality. It supports several databases, file formats, and cloud-based services.

#### b. Informatica

Informatica is an ETL tool used for extracting, transforming, and loading data into a data warehouse. It offers several features for data integration, data quality, and data migration.

#### c. Microsoft SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS)

SSIS is an ETL tool included in the Microsoft SQL Server suite of tools. It offers several features for data integration, data quality, and data transformation.

### 2. Business Intelligence Tools

Business Intelligence tools are used for reporting, analysis, and visualization of data stored in a data warehouse. Some popular BI tools include:

#### a. Tableau

Tableau is a data visualization tool used for creating interactive dashboards, reports, and charts. It can connect to a wide range of data sources, including data warehouses.

#### b. IBM Cognos Analytics

IBM Cognos Analytics is a business intelligence tool used for reporting, analysis, and scorecarding. It supports a wide range of data sources, including data warehouses.

#### c. Microsoft Power BI

Microsoft Power BI is a cloud-based business intelligence tool used for data visualization and analysis. It can connect to a wide range of data sources, including data warehouses.

## Conclusion

Data warehousing is an essential component of modern data management. It provides decision-makers with a reliable and centralized source of data while improving data quality and access. ETL tools and business intelligence tools are essential for the implementation of data warehouses.
