# Data Warehousing: Fundamental Knowledge to Usage of Tools

Data warehousing is a vital element in modern data pipelines, whereby businesses gather, store and analyze data ranging from customer preferences, sales trends, financial metrics, and everything in between. As firms rely on data to gain a competitive edge, having the right data warehousing strategy in place has become increasingly important to meet the growing demands of data-driven insights.

This post will delve into the basics of data warehousing, including what it is, how it works, and different tools and technologies used in the field. 

## What is Data Warehousing?

A data warehouse is a relational database designed for query and analysis instead of transaction processing. It provides storage for large amounts of structured and unstructured data that are subject-oriented, integrated, time-varying, and non-volatile. 

Subject-Oriented: The data in a data warehouse pertains to a specific area or subject, such as sales, human resources, or finance, as well as the business as a whole.

Integrated: The data is often integrated from various sources across the organization. The data must undergo transformation to be integrated and standardized for improved analytics.

Time-Varying: The data in a data warehouse changes over time. For instance, the sales figures of last year will be different from those of the current year. Therefore, the data warehouse should be able to support time-based data.

Non-Volatile: The data in a data warehouse is read-only, and so new data is appended and not overwritten. Also, the data is kept for a long time so that trends can be analyzed over time.

Data warehousing involves collecting, storing, and managing data from different sources to provide accurate, reliable, and a single view of business data. A data warehouse makes it easy to access data for analysis and decision-making processes. 

## How Data Warehousing Works

A typical data warehousing process consists of three stages, namely: 

### Extraction 

Extraction involves the process of collecting data from various sources such as operational databases, ERPs, CRMs and more. After data extraction, it is transformed and cleaned to fit into the data warehouse schema.

### Transformation

Data transformation involves the process of cleaning and standardizing data before inserting it into the data warehouse. It includes removing irrelevant data, fixing missing information, formatting the data, and removing duplicates. 

### Loading

Loading is the process of storing relevant data in the data warehouse. There are two types of loading, namely, batch processing and real-time processing. Batch processing loads large volumes of data at once, while real-time processing handles data in real-time.

After loading, the data is organized into separate tables based on subject areas. This makes it easier to access and analyze the data. The data can then be queried and analyzed by data analysts or business intelligence tools to provide insights into the performance of a company or business unit. 

## Tools and Technologies Used in Data Warehousing 

In data warehousing, there are several tools and technologies used to collect, process, and analyze data. We will discuss a few of them below.

### Amazon Redshift 

Amazon Redshift is a data warehousing solution that provides a petabyte-scale cloud-based data warehouse service. It is fast, scalable, and easy to use, especially for businesses that use Amazon Web Services (AWS). 

### Google BigQuery

Google BigQuery is a serverless, scalable, and low-cost data warehousing solution that allows users to query data using standard SQL. BigQuery can process terabytes of data in seconds and can scale to exabytes as needed. This makes BigQuery ideal for businesses that want to store data in the cloud and leverage advanced machine learning models to deliver a better customer experience. 

### Oracle Database 

Oracle Database is a classic data warehousing solution that has been in use for decades. It is scalable, fast, secure, and easy to deploy. Oracle Database is designed to meet the needs of modern businesses of all sizes. 

### Snowflake

Snowflake is a cloud-based data warehousing solution that is fast, secure, and scalable. It enables users to store, access, and analyze data from various sources using SQL queries. Snowflake separates compute and storage resources, allowing you to scale your resources according to your workload.

### Apache Hadoop 

Apache Hadoop is a popular open-source software framework that is used to store and process large, unstructured, and complex data sets efficiently. The framework consists of two parts: HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System) for storing data, and MapReduce for processing and querying data. 

## Conclusion

Data warehousing is critical to businesses that want to leverage data to make informed decisions and gain a competitive edge. This post has given an introduction to what data warehousing is, how it works, and some of the tools and technologies used in the field. Data warehousing is an ever-evolving field, and new innovations are constantly being developed.
