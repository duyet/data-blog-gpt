# Data Warehousing: Fundamental Knowledge to Usage of Tools

Data warehousing is an important aspect of data engineering, dealing with the process of creating and managing a centralized repository of data from a variety of sources. A data warehouse is specifically designed to support business intelligence activities, such as data analytics and reporting. The data warehouse consolidates data from different sources, transforms them into a structured format, and stores them in such a way as to facilitate efficient query and analysis.

## What is Data Warehousing?

Data warehousing is used to create a central repository of data that can be easily accessed and used by decision makers in an organization. A data warehouse is specifically designed to support business intelligence activities, such as data analytics and reporting. In addition, data warehousing provides a way for organizations to analyze data and extract meaningful insights that can inform business decisions.

## Features of a Data Warehouse

A data warehouse differs from traditional databases in that it is specifically designed to support analytical processing rather than transaction processing. Some features of a data warehouse include:

- **Consolidation of data:** A data warehouse consolidates data from different sources into a single, coherent data store.

- **Historical data:** A data warehouse stores historical data, making it possible to analyze patterns and trends over time.

- **Structured format:** Data in a data warehouse is structured in such a way as to support efficient querying and analysis.

- **Support for business intelligence activities:** A data warehouse is specifically designed to support business intelligence activities such as data analytics and reporting.

- **Separation of analytics and transaction processing:** A data warehouse is separated from transaction processing systems to avoid any interference.

## Data Warehousing Architecture

The architecture of a data warehouse is divided into three tiers: the bottom tier, the middle tier, and the top tier.

- **Bottom Tier:** This tier is the foundation and stores raw data from various sources such as spreadsheets, transaction systems, and other databases. It also involves the extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) process to move and transform data from the source systems to the data warehouse.

- **Middle Tier:** This tier is called the storage area and is used to store processed data in a structured manner. The most popular data storage technology used in the middle tier is relational database management system (RDBMS).

- **Top Tier:** This tier represents the presentation layer of the data warehouse, where users can access and browse data. It integrates data from various sources to provide a comprehensive view of the organizationâ€™s data. This level involves use of business intelligence (BI) tools such as reporting, online analytical processing (OLAP) and data visualization.

## Data Warehousing Tools

There are a lot of tools that are used in data warehousing, depending on the specific needs of the organization. Below are some tools that are often used:

- **Apache Hadoop:** This is an open-source software framework which allows for the storage and processing of very large data sets. Hadoop was designed to handle massive amounts of structured and unstructured data.

- **Amazon Redshift:** This is a cloud-based data warehousing solution provided by Amazon Web Services. It is optimized for OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) queries and can handle petabyte-scale data sets.

- **Snowflake:** This is another cloud-based data warehousing solution that specializes in handling multiple workloads. Snowflake separates the storage and compute functions for faster query processing.

- **Oracle Database:** This is a relational database management system that is popular in many organizations for data warehousing. Oracle is known for its scalability and comprehensive suite of data management tools.

- **Microsoft SQL Server:** This is another popular relational database management system used in data warehousing. SQL Server is known for its query optimization, high-speed data processing, and data analysis capabilities.

## Conclusion

Data warehousing is an essential aspect of data engineering, providing organizations with the ability to consolidate data from different sources into a centralized repository. A well-designed data warehouse enables an organization to analyze data, extract meaningful insights, and make informed business decisions for better ROI. The tools discussed in this article are just some of the popular options available in the market. Choosing the right tool depends on various factors such as organizational requirements, budget, scalability, and ease-of-use.
