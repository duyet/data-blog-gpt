# Apache Zookeeper: Managing Distributed Systems One Node at a Time

Apache ZooKeeper is a distributed coordination service for managing large distributed systems composed of nodes that work cooperatively together. It was originally designed at Yahoo in order to handle coordination tasks between the different components of Hadoop-based systems. Since then, however, the tool has found several other use cases in distributed applications as well.

In this blog post, we will dive into Apache ZooKeeper, from its fundamentals to its usage, and how it can benefit teams in data engineering. 

## Fundamentals of Apache ZooKeeper

### What is Apache ZooKeeper?
Apache Zookeeper is a distributed coordination service that enables synchronization across a distributed system. Considered an application's nervous system, it manages aspects including naming, grouping, and organization of services. ZooKeeper uses a hierarchical file system-like namespace called znodes that can hold data and is used to synchronize access to distributed resources.

### What is ZooKeeper used for?
Zookeeper can be used for a wide variety of tasks in distributed systems. Some of the most common use cases include:
- Configuration management.
- Leader election.
- Naming services.
- Distributed synchronization.
- Cluster management, and more.

### How does ZooKeeper work?
Zookeeper works by assigning a unique identifier (a sequence number) to each operation performed on it within the distributed system. This identifier is delivered to all nodes within the system, ensuring that each node has the latest information regarding the operations performed on the system. The process works in a consensus-based approach where all nodes can be considered to have the same information.

### ZooKeeper Architecture
ZooKeeper follows a replicated architecture in which all nodes are considered equal; there is no centralized node for coordination. The nodes are divided based on their roles:
- **Leader**: Manages writes and reads.
- **Follower**: Follows leader and only replicates data.
- **Observer**: Observes data changes. Does not participate in the leader-election process.

The nodes can communicate with each other via the Atomic Broadcast protocol. This protocol ensures that all nodes have the same view of the data while also enabling fast processing of requests.

## Getting Started with Apache ZooKeeper
Now that we have covered ZooKeeper's fundamentals let's dive into how to get started with the tool.

### Installing Apache ZooKeeper
In order to install ZooKeeper, visit the [official website](https://zookeeper.apache.org/releases.html) and download the latest stable release. Extract it to your preferred directory and make sure you set up the `ZOOKEEPER_HOME` environment variable. Once you do that, you are ready to get started.

### Starting Apache ZooKeeper
Starting ZooKeeper is easy! All you have to do is navigate to the `bin` directory within the ZooKeeper installation directory and run the command `./zkServer.sh start`.

### Usage of Apache ZooKeeper
As mentioned earlier, ZooKeeper can be used for a variety of tasks. Here are some common examples:
#### Managing Configuration Data
One of the primary use cases for ZooKeeper is managing configuration data. This could involve the storing of an application's configuration data and metadata or the management of components such as databases or file systems.

#### Naming Services
A common use case for ZooKeeper is to manage namespace and discovery services for distributed systems. This includes naming services to assign and discover unique names to different components on the network.

#### Leader Election
In a distributed system, there is always a risk of a split brain scenario, where multiple nodes believe that they are the leader. ZooKeeper manages the leader election process in a fail-safe manner. The leader has exclusive rights to write to the system while other nodes can only read from it.

## Conclusion
We hope this blog post provides you with the fundamentals of Apache ZooKeeper and its usage in distributed systems for data engineering. ZooKeeper is a powerful coordination tool that can greatly simplify the management of distributed systems. Once you get started with the tool, you should explore its capabilities and how it can aid your day-to-day operations.
