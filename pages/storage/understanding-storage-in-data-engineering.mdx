# Understanding Storage in Data Engineering

To understand data engineering, we must start with the basics, such as storage. In this article, we will explore storage systems commonly used in data engineering.

## Introduction to Storage Systems

Storage systems are critical components of data engineering. These systems provide a way to store data so that it can be processed efficiently. Generally, there are two types of storage systems - file-based and database-based.

### File-Based Storage

File-based storage systems store data in files on a file system. The data is typically saved in a structured format, such as CSV or JSON. These systems are useful when data needs to be saved in a simple and easy-to-read format. However, it can be difficult to query and aggregate data stored in this way.

Examples of file-based storage systems include Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS), Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3), and Google Cloud Storage.

### Database-Based Storage

Database-based storage systems store data in databases that are optimized for querying and aggregation. These systems provide a way to store data that can be easily queried, searched, and updated. Database-based storage systems typically use a structured query language (SQL) to interact with data.

Examples of database-based storage systems include PostgreSQL, MySQL, and Microsoft SQL Server.

## Considerations When Choosing a Storage System

When choosing a storage system, there are several considerations to take into account. These include data size, performance requirements, and cost.

### Data Size

The size of your data should be a primary consideration when selecting a storage system. If you have a small amount of data, a file-based system like S3 or HDFS may be a good choice. If you have a large amount of data that needs to be queried frequently, a database-based system like PostgreSQL may be a better choice.

### Performance Requirements

Performance requirements are also important when selecting a storage system. If you need fast querying times, a database-based system is likely the best choice. If performance is not a primary concern, a file-based system may be a more affordable option.

### Cost

The cost of storage is also an important consideration. File-based storage systems are typically more affordable than database-based systems. However, they may not provide the same performance or querying capabilities as database-based systems.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, choosing a storage system is an important decision when designing a data engineering pipeline. Considerations such as data size, performance requirements, and cost must be taken into account. Ultimately, the right storage system depends on the specific needs of your organization.
