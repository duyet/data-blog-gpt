## Introduction to Tableau

Tableau is a data visualization and business intelligence software that allows data engineers to analyze and visualize complex data sets in an easy-to-understand format. Tableau offers a wide range of features and functions that help data engineers to understand their data and share insights with others. With Tableau, data engineers can easily create interactive, visually appealing dashboards, and reports.

## Tableau Architecture

Tableau has a three-tier architecture - client, application server, and data server. The client tier is the Tableau desktop or web authoring interface. The application server tier manages all requests from users and is responsible for processing and rendering data on the client. The data server tier manages all interactions with data sources.

## Connectivity

Tableau provides connectivity to a wide range of data sources, including databases, spreadsheets, and cloud-based data sources. Tableau supports both live and extracted connections to data sources. Live connections enable real-time data analysis, while extracted connections allow users to work faster with larger data sets.

## Data Preparation

Tableau offers a range of data preparation tools that allow data engineers to clean, consolidate, and combine data from multiple sources. Tableau's data prep tools make it easy to handle data from different sources and make it ready for analysis.

## Data Visualization

Tableau provides a range of visualization options and features that help data engineers to create effective visualizations and reports. Tableau's drag and drop interface makes it easy to create charts, graphs, and other visuals that can be used for a range of data analysis and reporting purposes.

## Dashboard Development

Tableau makes it easy to create dynamic dashboards that allow users to interact with data in real-time. Dashboards can be customized according to user preferences and can be shared across different devices.

## Advanced Features and Functions

Tableau offers advanced features and functions that allow data engineers to create more complex visualizations and reports. These include advanced chart types, calculations, and forecasting tools.

## Tableau Server and Online

Tableau Server and Online allow data engineers to share reports and dashboards across the organization, ensuring that everyone has access to the latest data and insights. Tableau Server and Online also provide advanced security and governance features that are critical for many enterprises.

## Tableau for Big Data

Tableau can handle large datasets and can be used to visualize and analyze big data. Tableau can connect to Hadoop, Spark, and other big data sources, making it easier for data engineers to uncover insights from big data.

## Tableau Best Practices

To get the most out of Tableau, it is important to follow best practices. These include best practices for data preparation, visualization, and dashboard design. It is also important to select the right data sources, use appropriate visualizations, and ensure data accuracy and validity.
