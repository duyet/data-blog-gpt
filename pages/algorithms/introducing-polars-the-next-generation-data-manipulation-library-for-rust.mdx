# Introducing Polars: The Next Generation Data Manipulation Library for Rust

In the world of data engineering, efficient processing and manipulation of large datasets is of utmost importance. Traditional solutions such as Pandas, while powerful and popular, tend to struggle with larger datasets, especially when CPU resources are limited. In this blog post, we introduce Polars, a next-generation data manipulation library for Rust that is designed to overcome the limitations of Pandas while providing lightning-fast query speeds and a memory-efficient data loading process.

## What is Polars?

Polars is a Rust-based data manipulation library designed to provide fast query speeds, outperforming Pandas by up to 10x in certain benchmarks. It is designed to handle large volumes of data and is optimised for data processing in memory. Additionally, Polars can handle big data split into several files or compressed files, making it a versatile tool for working with huge datasets.

Polars is free and open-source, and it can be installed via standard Rust package managers. The library is designed to be relatively easy to use, and it includes numerous data manipulation functions similar to those found in Pandas. 

## How Polars compares to Pandas

Pandas is a widely-used data manipulation library for Python, and it is commonly used in the data engineering domain. However, it can slow down when dealing with large datasets, eating up significant amounts of memory in the process. 

Polars, on the other hand, is optimised for in-memory data processing, making it vastly more efficient than Pandas when dealing with bigger datasets. According to benchmarks, Polars can outperform Pandas by 10x or more, making it an essential tool for large-scale data processing projects.

## Key features of Polars

### 1. A simplified data frame syntax

Polars provides a simplified syntax for working with data frames, which simplifies operations even further. The syntax is more precise than Pandas, allowing you to chain and combine operators quickly and easily with minimal code duplication.

### 2. Faster query performance

As noted, Polars is designed to handle large datasets efficiently, and it excels at fast query speeds. The library employs lazy evaluation in query processing, which eliminates unnecessary computation, resulting in faster processing times.

### 3. Multiple file formats compatibility

Polars is compatible with various file formats such as CSV, JSON, and Parquet, making it versatile enough to handle different types of data. It can also load compressed data files, making it a great choice when working with larger datasets.

### 4. Integration with Rust and ability for Python bindings

Polars is built in Rust and has a convenient Python binding. With its binding, data engineers can use them from Python interchangeably. Furthermore, leveraging Rust, a memory-safe language eliminates the cost of managing memory allocation and deallocation.

### 5. Easy Extension

Polars can easily extend native rust functionality with python or with rust. With Arrow format and data fusion, one can extend polars data manipulation functionality easily.

## How to use Polars for data engineering

Polars installation is outlined in details on its official website. The process of installing Polars is quick and easy, and its syntax is relatively straightforward as well. 

Once installed, you can load data from various sources, including a CSV file, and begin exploring and manipulating it using Polars' simplified syntax. Data engineers can perform operations such as groupby, filtering, join, and many more, just like in Pandas. However, with no precedence for string operations, polars move its functionality to the `lazy` module. 

## Conclusion

Polars is a modern-day data manipulation library for Rust that is faster, memory-efficient, versatile and easy to use. Its structuring is built in memory-safe Rust and Python bindings, opening up more avenues for big data processing. Its integration with Rust and ability to be extended with Arrow and Data fusion make it an excellent choice for data engineering projects, especially those that require faster processing on a larger scale. If you are looking to manipulate big data, you should give Polars a try.
